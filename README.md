## Step 1: One Dimensional Linear Convection

Convection is the directed flow of a property.

The 1-D linear convection equation:
```math
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0.
```

The 2-D nonlinear convection equation:
```math
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0.
```

The 1-D diffusion equation:
```math
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} - \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0.
```
